# 🧾 Documentation Structure Standard

## ⚠ Canonical Enforcement Notice

This document defines the **canonical structure** for all official documentation types within the organization.  
Any markdown document designated as a `Process`, `Procedure`, `Policy`, or `Standard` must conform to these layout and formatting rules.

---

## ✅ Required Header Blocks

Each document **shall begin** with the following sections, in this order:

### 1. `# {Title}`
- Title must describe the document purpose.
- Use an appropriate emoji if applicable (e.g., 🧪 for testing, 📘 for standards).

### 2. `## ⚠ Canonical Enforcement Notice`
Standard language:
> This document defines a **canonical {type}**.  
> Use of this document is optional. However, once adopted, all instructions and structures herein must be followed without deviation by developers and AI agents.

*(Replace `{type}` with “procedure”, “process”, etc.)*

### 3. `## 📘 Purpose`
- Clearly state what the document covers and when it is used.

### 4. `## 🗂 Scope` *(optional but encouraged)*
- Define the range of systems, files, or contexts the document applies to.

## 🧱 Formatting Rules

- Use `PascalCase` filenames with dots (e.g., `Testing.Process.md`)
- Use backticks ` for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks
- Use tables for lists, comparisons, or requirements where possible
- Always list supporting documents under `📚 Supporting Documents`
- Use declarative voice (e.g., "The developer shall...")

## 📚 Example-Compliant Documents

- `Testing.ChatGPTInterface.Procedure.md`
- `Documentation.NamingConventions.md`

## 🧠 Continuous Improvement

This structure standard shall be reviewed and updated as new documentation patterns emerge.
