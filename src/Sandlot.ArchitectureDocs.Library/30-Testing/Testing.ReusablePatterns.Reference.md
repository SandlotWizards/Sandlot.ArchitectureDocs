# ðŸ§ª Reusable Testing Patterns Reference

## âš  Canonical Enforcement Notice

This document defines a **canonical reference** of reusable testing patterns.  
Use of this document is optional. However, once a pattern is referenced or adopted in any test procedure, it must be followed precisely.  
AI agents and developers shall incorporate these patterns wherever applicable to reduce error, enforce consistency, and minimize rework.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

To catalog known and validated patterns for generating effective, maintainable, and testable code across all test types.  
This reference enables both AI and developers to apply battle-tested fixes and structures proactively during test suite generation.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Scope

This reference applies to all test types generated by or maintained within the organization, including unit tests, domain tests, integration tests, CLI service tests, and MobileFrame replication tests.

## âœ… Reusable Pattern Matrix

| Pattern ID | Pattern Name                            | Description                                                                                      | Usage Context                                |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| F11        | Subclass Override Tracking              | When an internal non-virtual method cannot be directly verified, create a subclass and override it. Use for internal logic capture. | Internal-only method testing (e.g., services) |
| F12        | IntelliSense Snip Error Reporting       | When Visual Studio identifies a problem with squiggly underlines, use Snipping Tool with delay to capture tooltip. Paste into chat. | ChatGPTInterface testing loop                |
| F13        | Downstream Side Effect Verification     | When a method cannot be overridden, verify downstream side effects (e.g., logging, tracking) instead. | Internal non-virtual behaviors               |
| F14        | AAA Enforcement with Exceptions         | If a test cannot use Arrangeâ€“Actâ€“Assert, document reasoning and use clear sections to maintain readability. | Complex or non-standard test flows           |

## ðŸ§  Continuous Improvement

New patterns shall be added based on:
- Developer retrospectives
- AI-generated suggestions flagged as reusable
- Fixes to recurring issues observed across test suites

All proposed additions must be reviewed and explicitly accepted before inclusion in this reference.
