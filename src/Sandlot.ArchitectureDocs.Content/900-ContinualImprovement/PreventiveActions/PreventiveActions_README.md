# ðŸ§° Preventive Actions

This folder contains actions taken to mitigate potential risks before they result in quality issues or system failures.

## Purpose
Preventive Actions are **proactive measures** designed to eliminate the causes of potential nonconformities or breakdowns. These align with Six Sigmaâ€™s defect prevention focus and support architectural resiliency and long-term maintainability.

## Examples
- Adding retry logic for unreliable dependencies
- Creating linting or test rules based on past weak spots
- Validating user input more defensively
