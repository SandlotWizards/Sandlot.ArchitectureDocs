# ðŸ›  Corrective Actions

This folder documents actions taken to resolve known failures, process deviations, or quality concerns discovered within the system or development workflow.

## Purpose
Corrective Actions are **reactive measures**. They aim to identify and eliminate the root causes of nonconformities or defects, ensuring the issue does not recur. These actions are grounded in principles aligned with ISO 9001 and IATF 16949 continuous improvement practices.

## Examples
- Addressing failures after a botched deployment
- Updating logic after inconsistent Copilot behavior
- Fixes prompted by retrospective findings
