# ðŸ’¡ Opportunities for Improvement

This folder is a think tank space â€” a home for speculative ideas, "what ifs", and forward-looking architectural possibilities.

## Purpose
Opportunities for Improvement are **exploratory and creative**. They are not bound by implementation roadmaps and do not require a known defect to justify their existence. This space supports innovation and organic evolution, fostering a healthy improvement culture.

## Guidelines
- No idea is too small or too big.
- Proposals can emerge from hunches, comparisons, or wishful thinking.
- Ideas may eventually graduate into proposals or preventive actions.

## Examples
- What if the ActionLogger supported OpenTelemetry?
- Could CLI orchestration be event-driven instead of linear?
- What if we templated our process documentation from a CLI wizard?
