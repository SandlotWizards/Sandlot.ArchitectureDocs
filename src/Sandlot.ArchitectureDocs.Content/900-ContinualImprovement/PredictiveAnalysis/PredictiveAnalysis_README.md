# ðŸ“ˆ Predictive Analysis

This folder contains data-driven forecasts, simulations, and projections used to anticipate future architectural, performance, or capability needs.

## Purpose
Predictive Analysis uses modeling or historical data to anticipate trends and system behavior. It enables evidence-based design choices and supports proactive planning under uncertainty.

## Examples
- Projecting build times as complexity grows
- Anticipating Copilot inference costs at scale
- Modeling team velocity or CI/CD throughput
